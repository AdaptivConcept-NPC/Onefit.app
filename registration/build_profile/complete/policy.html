<h1>No Warranties</h1>
<p>The Application is provided to You "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" and with all

    statutory or otherwise, with respect to the Application, including all implied warranties of

    components.</p>
<p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or limitations on
    applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and
    limitations
    may not apply to You. But in such a case the exclusions and limitations set forth in this
    section
    shall be applied to the greatest extent enforceable under applicable law. To the extent any

    Application or 100 USD if You haven&#39;t purchased anything through the Application.</p>
<p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Company or its
    suppliers
    be liable for any special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever &#40;including,

    interruption, for personal injury, loss of privacy arising out of or in any way related to the

    with
    the Application, or otherwise in connection with any provision of this Agreement&#41;, even if the
    Company or any supplier has been advised of the possibility of such damages and even if the
    remedy
    fails of its essential purpose.</p>
<p>Some states/jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
    consequential
    damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to You.</p>

    changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent

    effect.
</p>
<h2>Waiver</h2>
<p>Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to require performance of an
    obligation under this Agreement shall not effect a party&#39;s ability to exercise such right or
